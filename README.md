# KFlow
This project is an attempt to recreate the TensorFlow environment for AI. The project will thus include some of the
functionality as Tensorflow and about the same user interface. However, this project does not want to be faster or
more optimized than Tensorflow. It is pure for educational purpose: to show how to code all that stuff that is behind
Tensorflow. The resulting code will be several times slower than the CPU version of Tensorflow.
